This is one of the Coursera assignments provided in the Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow course in the week 2 section where it discusses Word Embeddings. This assignment is about tokenizing words from the BBC news reports dataset. This dataset contains articles that are classified into a number of different categories. Where we will design a neural network that can be trained on this dataset to accurately determine what words determine what category and then create the vecs.tsv and meta.tsv files and load them into the embedding projector.
